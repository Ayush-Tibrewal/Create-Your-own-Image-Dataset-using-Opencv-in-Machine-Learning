# Create-Your-own-Image-Dataset-using-Opencv-in-Machine-Learning
Introduction
Machine learning and images have a great relationship, the image classification has been one of the main roles of machine learning over the years. It has been of great use during the COVID-19 pandemic to recognize people who are not following the rules like wearing masks and maintaining distance.

Pre-requisites
Every program has some pre-requisites to resolve problems related to the environment. We are here building a dataset for a Machine Learning project, the minimal requirement for this is a machine with python3 installed and a module of OpenCV on it.

Python3
Opencv
I am using Jupyter Notebook in my system. If you also want to use the same setup you have to install Anaconda on your machine and then install OpenCV.

Hello Geeks! In this article, we are going to prepare our personal image dataset using OpenCV for any kind of machine learning project. For example, we have prepare data for Rockâ€¦..Paperâ€¦.Scissor game. So lets get startedâ€¦. ðŸ˜‰

Install OpenCV

To install OpenCV, open the command prompt if you are not using anaconda. Otherwise open anaconda-prompt from windows search and type the below-given command.

pip install opencv-python=3.4.2.17
Now you are all set to code and prepare your dataset.
